TicTacToc
=========
Android Tic Tac Toe application with a time element. If the player doesn't make their move before the time runs out, they lose
their turn.

Players can pick a picture from their device's gallery to use as their "space" or use the default red/green drawables.

Includes a menu in the Score screen where players can reset the game or change the time allotted for making a move.

To play, install the TicTacToc apk file in the bin folder onto an Android device or emulator.
